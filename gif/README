The script is divided into two parts, the 'main' and the 'modifier'.

The main calls the functions defined in the modifier script and 
leads the user during the run.

You may want to modify some lines in the main file. The modifier file
has some lines which must be modified, for example the line where 
the function 'replacer' calls the lines that must be modified when 
using .pov file generated with MOLDRAW (replace the path to that file,
linesToModPOVRAY.dat.
