The script is divided into two parts, the 'main' and the 'modifier',
both must be in the same directory when running, and main can be 
remotely called from the directory where your .pov files are located.

The main calls the functions defined in the modifier script and 
leads the user during the run.

You may want to modify some lines in the main file. The modifier file
has some lines which must be modified, for example the line where 
the function 'replacer' calls the lines that must be modified when 
using .pov file generated with MOLDRAW (replace the path to that file,
linesToModPOVRAY.dat, this file contains the changes that must be performed
to all .pov ray files (are definitions of colors, sizes...) and 
in case that more atoms are added, it must be modified as well to 
include them, originally only H, C and O are included).

In case you want to modify the resolution (size) of the .png and subsequently 
of the .gif you will have to modify it from the modifier file, in the function 
that generates the .INI for povRAY (INIFile_creator). To do so, change 
+W1600 +H1200 to the values you want. Bear in mind that the higher the resolution, 
the slower the process.

You can modify as well the line concerning th gif generation, in the 
function videoGeneratorHQ. In that function you will find that a video 
can be generated, but I omitted it since gifs are more suitable for presentations.
